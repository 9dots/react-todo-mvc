# Redux TodoMVC Example

To work on this project, import this project in [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io). Starting from this boilerplate (from the [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) examples), add the following functionality (without breaking the previous tests)

## Functionality

### Add Firebase

Sign up for a free [firebase](https://firebase.google.com) account. Enable the firestore database and google authentication (check the firebase docs for details). Set up the project to use your firebase project.

### Add Authentication

Add a login page that gets rendered if the user is not yet logged in. The user should be able to login using Google. There should also be a way for logged in users to sign out.

### Store Todos in Database

The project should store all todos in the firestore database. Users should only be able to see their own todos.
